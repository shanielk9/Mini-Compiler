# Mini Compiler
 
**Compiler for a mini programming language that described by a given grammar, built as part of Theory of Compilation course (programming in C, using Visual Studio)**

It has been built as a series of three incremental phases, each contributing a key part of the compiler.<br>

| Phase     | Objective                                                                                               |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project 1 | Building a lexical analyser using Lex for a mini programming language that described by a given grammar |
| Project 2 | Building a parser by reading tokens from the lexical analyser from Project 1                      |
| Project 3 | Building a semantic analyser for the grammar implemented in Project 2                                   |   

The Mini-Compiler compiles the program and shows the output of each phase of compiler in different output file.<br>
**NOTE**: put the test files (test1 and test2) in the directory: C:\temp
